     * can be customized with a comparator callback. This should be a curried function which takes
     * first the left value and key, then the right value and key, and returns a boolean.
     *
     * This operation will stop and return a value as soon as one of the collections has been seen fully
     * or as soon as the comparison yields false for any key-value pair.
