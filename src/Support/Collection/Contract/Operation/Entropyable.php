     * This method extends the library's functionality by allowing users to calculate
     * the normalized Shannon entropy of each item in a collection. Since it is not
     * possible to calculate it lazily just like in the `average` operation, this
     * operation returns a collection of entropy values, calculated individually for
     * each item. Therefore, if you're looking for the entropy of the whole collection,
     * you must get the last item using `last` operation.
     *
     * The implementation provides the normalized version of Shannon entropy.
     * Normalization ensures that the entropy value is scaled between `0` and `1`,
     * making it easier to compare entropy across different collections, irrespective
     * of their size or the diversity of elements they contain.
     *
     * An entropy of `0` indicates no diversity (all elements are the same), while an
     * entropy of `1` signifies maximum diversity (all elements are different).
